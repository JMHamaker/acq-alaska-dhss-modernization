In order for offers to be considered responsive offerors must meet the following minimum requirements:

-   The offeror must provide two examples of web-based platforms. While not required, we strongly prefer that at least one of these projects have been developed and released using open source principles and licensing. The examples provided must reflect aspects of data security, and should show aspects of strong user driven design in a web application.** The projects must have been delivered by either a) the offeror itself or, alternatively, b) a teaming partner that is proposed in response to this RFP, or, alternatively, c) any Key Personnel that is being proposed in response to this RFP. In the project summary, be sure to identify how the offeror’s team was involved in the development. At a minimum, provide:

    -   Recent and similar technical scope is past experience with
        building usable, responsive, user-facing web applications,
        within the past three (3) years.

    -   The summary shall include links to the public Git repository
        that includes the source code that was developed and accepted
        for the project. Actual access to a publicly available Git
        repository is strongly encouraged over screenshots of private
        repositories. The summary should also include live links of the
        final product or current staging environment. If live links are
        not available, screenshots can be provided, along with a brief
        explanation as to why the project is no longer live. Note that
        screenshots will not be counted towards your 7-page limitation;
        please provide screenshots as attachments. The projects should
        be recent and similar to the size and technical scope of this
        requirement.

-   The vendor must have experience working with clients using modern
    software development approaches. These approaches must include
    cross-functional teams that use human-centered design, build with
    modern technology stacks, and use an iterative, agile approach to
    continuously deliver working software to their clients;

-   The vendor’s team must ensure their agile ceremonies are conducted
    at times that are consistent with the State of Alaska’s normal
    business hours (8:00AM–5:00PM Alaska Prevailing Time).

An offeror's failure to meet these minimum requirements may cause their proposal to be considered non-responsive and their proposal may be rejected.

## Section 2. BACKGROUND INFORMATION

### <a name="2.01"></a>Sec. 2.01 Background Information

BACKGROUND

The background for this project as a whole is detailed in the project README. In short, for this first acquisition, we want to focus on something that is relatively straightforward, while still providing value to our beneficiaries and constituents. The product team has decided that building a robust person search would create a positive impact in a way that introduces the least risk to existing systems. We will learn a lot during this first acquisition that will help us tackle more invasive and risky acquisitions later on.

OBJECTIVES

Alaska Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) goals for the person search are as follows:

Decreased burden on Division of Public Assistance (DPA) field staff as they process incoming applications for program benefits

Get a better sense of the nature of pending work by revealing all unworked applications for a given person or household

Increase the number of applications processed per worker, per day, so that potential beneficiaries can get their benefits sooner

Decrease time necessary for DPA field staff to get critical information on outstanding applications or ongoing assistance cases

Build the foundation for a performant and flexible search API that can be reused throughout the application for any view

introductions will not be allocated to business development purposes.

Although the technical factors are identified in the RFP, the core
questions are not listed there. Offerors must be prepared to answer
questions about the technical aspects of their proposal. The goal of
these presentations is to assess the technical abilities of the proposed
Key Personnel and further elaborate on their proposed technical approach
described in their written proposal to accomplish the objectives of this
task.

This part of the verbal presentations will not exceed 40 minutes. The
Procurement Officer will strictly enforce this time limit on all
presentations. There will be no follow-up session for further questions
after this part of the presentation.

#### Presentation date and time

The State will schedule the date and time of the verbal presentations
with each Offeror after the solicitation closing date and receiving each

In order to determine if a proposal is reasonably susceptible for award,
communications by the procurement officer or the proposal evaluation
committee (PEC) are permitted with an offeror to clarify uncertainties
or eliminate confusion concerning the contents of a proposal.
Clarifications may not result in a material or substantive change to the
proposal. The evaluation by the procurement officer or the PEC may be
adjusted as a result of a clarification under this section.

### <a name="6.05"></a>Sec. 6.05 Discussions with Offerors

The state may conduct discussions with offerors in accordance with AS

Discussions will be limited to specific sections of the RFP or proposal
identified by the procurement officer. Discussions will only be held
with offerors who have submitted a proposal deemed reasonably
susceptible for award by the procurement officer. Discussions, if held,
will be after initial evaluation of proposals by the procurement officer
or the PEC. If modifications are made as a result of these discussions
they will be put in writing. Following discussions, the procurement
officer may set a time for best and final proposal submissions from
those offerors with whom discussions were held. Proposals may be
reevaluated after receipt of best and final proposal submissions.

After receipt of proposals, if there is a need for any substantial
clarification or material change in the RFP, an amendment will be
issued. The amendment will incorporate the clarification or change, and
a new date and time established for new or amended proposals.
Evaluations may be adjusted as a result of receiving new or amended
proposals.

### <a name="6.06"></a>Sec. 6.06 Contract Negotiation

After final evaluation, the procurement officer may negotiate with the
offeror of the highest-ranked proposal. Negotiations, if held, shall be
within the scope of the request for proposals and limited to those items
which would not have an effect on the ranking of proposals. If the
highest-ranked offeror fails to provide necessary information for
negotiations in a timely manner, or fails to negotiate in good faith,

the next highest-ranked proposal.

### <a name="6.07"></a>Sec. 6.07 Failure to Negotiate

and commence negotiations with the next highest ranked offeror.

### <a name="6.08"></a>Sec. 6.08 Offeror Notification of Selection

prospective bidder or offeror whose economic interest might be affected
substantially and directly by the issuance of a contract solicitation,
the award of a contract, or the failure to award a contract."

If an interested party wishes to protest the content of a solicitation,
the protest must be received, in writing, by the procurement officer at
least ten days prior to the deadline for receipt of proposals.

AS 36.30.560 also provides that an interested party may protest the
award of a contract or the proposed award of a contract.

award of a contract, the protest must be received, in writing, by the
procurement officer within ten days after the date the Notice of Intent
to Award the contract is issued.

A protester must have submitted a proposal in order to have sufficient

    contract at issue;

-   a detailed statement of the legal and factual grounds of the protest

Protests filed by telex or telegram are not acceptable because they do
not contain a signature. Fax copies containing a signature are
acceptable.

The procurement officer will issue a written response to the protest.
The response will set out the procurement officer's decision and contain
the basis of the decision within the statutory time limit in AS
36.30.580. A copy of the decision will be furnished to the protester by
certified mail, fax or another method that provides evidence of receipt.

All offerors will be notified of any protest. The review of protests,
decisions of the procurement officer, appeals, and hearings, will be
conducted in accordance with the State Procurement Code (AS 36.30),
Article 8 "Legal and Contractual Remedies.”

The Division of Vocational Rehabilitation in the Department of Labor and
Workforce Development keeps a list of qualified employment programs and
individuals who qualify as persons with a disability. As evidence of a
business’ or an individual's right to the Employment Program or Alaskans
with Disabilities preferences, the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation
will issue a certification letter. To take advantage of these
preferences, a business or individual must be on the appropriate
Division of Vocational Rehabilitation list prior to the time designated
for receipt of proposals. Offerors must attach a copy of their
certification letter to the proposal. **An offeror's failure to provide
this certification letter with their proposal will cause the state to
disallow the preference.**

### <a name="6.11"></a>Sec. 6.11 Alaska Bidder Preference

An Alaska Bidder Preference of 5% will be applied to the price in the
proposal. The preference will be given to an offeror who:

1.  holds a current Alaska business license prior to the deadline for
    receipt of proposals;

1.  submits a proposal for goods or services under the name appearing on
    the offeror’s current Alaska business license;

1.  has maintained a place of business within the state staffed by the
    offeror, or an employee of the offeror, for a period of six months
    immediately preceding the date of the proposal;

    state, is a sole proprietorship and the proprietor is a resident of
    the state, is a limited liability company (LLC) organized under AS
    10.50 and all members are residents of the state, or is a

    residents of the state; and

1.  if a joint venture, is composed entirely of ventures that qualify
    under (1)-(4) of this subsection.

#### Alaska Bidder Preference Statement

In order to receive the Alaska Bidder Preference, the proposal must
include a statement certifying that the offeror is eligible to receive
the Alaska Bidder Preference.

If the offeror is a LLC or partnership as identified in (4) of this
subsection, the statement must also identify each member or partner and
include a statement certifying that all members or partners are
residents of the state.

If the offeror is a joint venture which includes a LLC or partnership as
identified in (4) of this subsection, the statement must also identify
each member or partner of each LLC or partnership that is included in
the joint venture and include a statement certifying that all of those
members or partners are residents of the state.

### <a name="6.12"></a>Sec. 6.12 Alaska Veteran Preference

An Alaska Veteran Preference of 5%, not to exceed $5,000, will be
applied to the price in the proposal. The preference will be given to an
offeror who qualifies under AS 36.30.990(2) as an Alaska bidder and is
a:

A.  sole proprietorship owned by an Alaska veteran;

B.  partnership under AS 32.06 or AS 32.11 if a majority of the partners
    are Alaska veterans;

#### Alaska Veteran Preference Statement

In order to receive the Alaska Veteran Preference, the proposal must
include a statement certifying that the offeror is eligible to receive
the Alaska Veteran Preference.

### <a name="6.13"></a>Sec. 6.13 Alaska Offeror Preference

2 AAC 12.260(e) provides Alaska offerors a 10% overall evaluation point
preference. Alaska bidders, as defined in AS 36.30.990(2), are eligible
for the preference. An Alaska offeror will receive 10 percent of the
total available points added to their overall evaluation score as a
preference.

### <a name="6.14"></a>Sec. 6.14 Formula Used to Convert Cost to Points

The distribution of points based on cost will be determined as set out
in 2 AAC 12.260(c). The lowest cost proposal will receive the maximum
number of points allocated to cost. The point allocations for cost on
the other proposals will be determined using the formula:

*\[(Price of Lowest Cost Proposal) x (Maximum Points for Cost)\] ÷ (Cost
of Each Higher Priced Proposal)*

### <a name="6.15"></a>Sec. 6.15 Examples: Converting Cost to Points & Applying Preferences

#### (a) Formula Used to Convert Cost to Points

##### Step 1

List all proposal prices, adjusted where appropriate by the application
of applicable preferences claimed by the offeror.

|         |    |         |
|---------|----|---------|
| Offeror | #1 | $40,000 |
| Offeror | #2 | $42,750 |
| Offeror | #3 | $47,500 |

##### Step 2

In this example, the RFP allotted 40% of the available 100 points to cost. This means that the lowest cost will receive the maximum number of points.

##### Offeror #1 receives 40 points.

The reason they receive that amount is because the lowest cost proposal,
in this case $40,000, receives the maximum number of points allocated
to cost, 40 points.

##### Offeror #2 receives 37.4 points.

*$40,000 lowest cost x 40 maximum points for cost = 1,600,000 ÷
$42,750 cost of Offeror #2’s proposal =* **37.4**

**Offeror #3 receives 33.7 points.**

*$40,000 lowest cost x 40 maximum points for cost = 1,600,000 ÷ $47,500 cost of Offeror #3’s proposal* = **33.7**

#### (b) Alaska Offeror Preference

##### Step 1

Determine the number of points available to qualifying offerors under
this preference.

100 Total Points Available in RFP x 10% Alaska offerors preference = 10
Points for the Preference

##### Step 2

Determine which offerors qualify as Alaska bidders and thus, are
eligible for the Alaska offerors preference. For the purpose of this
example, presume that all of the proposals have been completely
evaluated based on the evaluation criteria in the RFP. The scores at
this point are:

|            |           |                            |           |
|------------|-----------|----------------------------|-----------|
| Offeror #1 | 83 points | No Preference              | 0 points  |
| Offeror #2 | 74 points | Alaska Offerors Preference | 10 points |
| Offeror #3 | 80 points | Alaska Offerors Preference | 10 points |

##### Step 3

Add the applicable Alaska offerors preference amounts to the offeror’s scores:

|            |           |                         |
|------------|-----------|-------------------------|
| Offeror #1 | 83 points |                         |
| Offeror #2 | 84 points | (74 points + 10 points) |
| **Offeror #3** | **90 points** | **(80 points + 10 points)** |

##### Step 4

**Offeror #3** is the highest scoring offeror and would get the award, provided their proposal is responsible and responsive.

**Instructions for Certification**

1.  By signing and submitting this Proposal, the prospective recipient
    of Federal assistance funds is providing the certification as set
    out below.

2.  The certification in this class is a material representation of fact
    upon which reliance was placed when this transaction was entered

    Federal assistance funds knowingly rendered an erroneous
    certification, in addition to other remedies available to the
    Federal Government, the Department of Labor (DOL) may pursue
    available remedies, including suspension and/or debarment.

3.  The prospective recipient of Federal assistance funds shall provide
    immediate written notice to the person to whom this Proposal is
    submitted if at any time the prospective recipient of Federal
    assistance funds learns that its certification was erroneous when

    circumstances.

4.  The terms "covered transaction," "debarred," "suspended,"
    "ineligible," "lower tier covered transaction," "participant,"

5.  The prospective recipient of Federal assistance funds agrees by
    submitting this Proposal that, should the proposed covered
    transaction be entered into, it shall not knowingly enter into any
    lower tier covered transaction with a person who is debarred,
    suspended, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from
    participation in this covered transaction, unless authorized by the
    DOL.

6.  The prospective recipient of Federal assistance funds further agrees
    by submitting this Proposal that it will include the clause titled

7.  A participant in a covered transaction may rely upon a certification
    of a prospective participant in a lower tier covered transaction
    that it is not debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily
    excluded from the covered transaction, unless it knows that the
    certification is erroneous. A participant may decide the method and
    frequency by which it determines the eligibility of its principals.
    Each participant may but is not required to check the List of
    Parties Excluded from Procurement or Non-procurement Programs.

8.  Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require
    establishment of a system of records in order to render in good
    faith the certification required by this clause. The knowledge and
    information of a participant is not required to exceed that which is
    normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of
    business dealings.

9.  Except for transactions authorized under paragraph 5 of these
    instructions, if a participant in a covered transaction knowingly
    enters into a lower tier covered transaction with a person who is
    suspended, debarred, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from
    participation in this transaction, in addition to other remedies
    available to the Federal Government, the DOL may pursue available
    remedies, including suspension and/or debarment

including those provisions in any contract or subcontract, as required
by this contract, “contractor” and “subcontractor” may be changed to
reflect appropriately the name or designation of the parties of the
contract or subcontract.

4.5.  The contractor shall cooperate fully with State efforts which seek
    to deal with the problem of unlawful discrimination, and with all
    other State efforts to guarantee fair employment practices under
    this contract, and promptly comply with all requests and
    directions from the State Commission for Human Rights or any of
    its officers or agents relating to prevention of discriminatory
    employment practices.

4.6.  Full cooperation in paragraph 4.5 includes, but is not limited to,
    being a witness in any proceeding involving questions of unlawful
    discrimination if that is requested by any official or agency of
    the State of Alaska; permitting employees of the contractor to be
    witnesses or complainants in any proceeding involving questions of
    unlawful discrimination, if that is requested by any official or
    agency of the State of Alaska; participating in meetings;
    submitting periodic reports on the equal employment aspects of
    present and future employment; assisting inspection of the
    contractor's facilities; and promptly complying with all State
    directives considered essential by any office or agency of the
    State of Alaska to insure compliance with all federal and State
    laws, regulations, and policies pertaining to the prevention of
    discriminatory employment practices.

4.7.  Failure to perform under this article constitutes a material breach
    of contract.

The contractor and any agents and employees of the contractor act in an
independent capacity and are not officers or employees or agents of the
State in the performance of this contract.

As a condition of performance of this contract, the contractor shall pay
all federal, State, and local taxes incurred by the contractor and shall
require their payment by any Subcontractor or any other persons in the

remain the sole property of the State of Alaska and may be used by the
State for any other purpose without additional compensation to the

establish any claim under the design patent or copyright laws.

and agrees that, among other things, provisions in any documents it
seeks to append hereto that purport to (1) waive the State of Alaska’s
sovereign immunity, (2) impose indemnification obligations on the State
of Alaska, or (3) limit liability of the contractor for acts of

## APPENDIX B: INDEMNITY AND INSURANCE

### Article 1. Indemnification

The Contractor shall indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the
contracting agency from and against any claim of, or liability for
error, omission or negligent act of the Contractor under this agreement.
The Contractor shall not be required to indemnify the contracting agency
for a claim of, or liability for, the independent negligence of the
contracting agency. If there is a claim of, or liability for, the joint
negligent error or omission of the Contractor and the independent
negligence of the Contracting agency, the indemnification and hold
harmless obligation shall be apportioned on a comparative fault basis.
“Contractor” and “Contracting agency”, as used within this and the
following article, include the employees, agents and other contractors
who are directly responsible, respectively, to each. The term
“independent negligence” is negligence other than in the Contracting
agency’s selection, administration, monitoring, or controlling of the
Contractor and in approving or accepting the Contractor’s work.

Without limiting contractor's indemnification, it is agreed that
contractor shall purchase at its own expense and maintain in force at
all times during the performance of services under this agreement the
following policies of insurance. Where specific limits are shown, it is
understood that they shall be the minimum acceptable limits. If the
contractor's policy contains higher limits, the state shall be entitled
to coverage to the extent of such higher limits. Certificates of
Insurance must be furnished to the contracting officer prior to
beginning work and must provide for a notice of cancellation,
non-renewal, or material change of conditions in accordance with policy
provisions. Failure to furnish satisfactory evidence of insurance or
lapse of the policy is a material breach of this contract and shall be
grounds for termination of the contractor's services. All insurance
policies shall comply with and be issued by insurers licensed to
transact the business of insurance under AS 21.

**2.1 Workers' Compensation Insurance:** The Contractor shall provide
and maintain, for all employees engaged in work under this contract,

**ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1996 ("HIPAA")**
**BUSINESS ASSOCIATE AGREEMENT**

This HIPAA Business Associate Agreement is between the State of Alaska,
Department of Health and Social Services (“Covered Entity” or “CE”) and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
(“Business Associate” or “BA”).

**RECITALS**

Whereas,

A. CE wishes to disclose certain information to BA, some of which may constitute Protected Health Information ("PHI");

B. It is the goal of CE and BA to protect the privacy and provide for
the security of PHI owned by CE that is disclosed to BA or accessed,
received, stored, maintained, modified or retained by BA in compliance
with HIPAA (42 U.S.C. 1320d – 3120d-8) and its implementing
regulations at 45 C.F.R. 160 and 45 C.F.R. 164 (the “Privacy and
Security Rule”), the Health Information Technology for Economic and
Clinical Health Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-5) (the “HITECH Act”), and with
other applicable laws;

C. The purpose and goal of the HIPAA Business Associate Agreement
("BAA") is to satisfy certain standards and requirements of HIPAA,
HITECH Act, and the Privacy and Security Rule, including but not
limited to 45 C.F.R. 164.502(e) and 45 C.F.R. 164.504(e), as may be
amended from time to time;

**Therefore,** in consideration of mutual promises below and the
exchange of information pursuant to the BAA, CE and BA agree as follows:

1. *Definitions*.

	a. *General*: As used in this BAA, the terms "Protected Health
Information," "Health Care Operations," and other capitalized terms have
the same meaning given to those terms by HIPAA, the HITECH Act and the
Privacy and Security Rule. In the event of any conflict between the
mandatory provisions of HIPAA, the HITECH Act or the Privacy and
Security Rule, and the provisions of this BAA, HIPAA, the HITECH Act or
the Privacy and Security Rule shall control. Where the provisions of
this BAA differ from those mandated by HIPAA, the HITECH Act or the
Privacy and Security Rule but are nonetheless permitted by HIPAA, the
HITECH Act or the Privacy and Security Rule, the provisions of the BAA
shall control.

	b. *Specific*:
	
	1) *Business Associate*: “Business Associate” or “BA” shall generally have the same meaning as the term “business associate” at 45 C.F.R. 160.103.

	2) *Covered Entity*: “Covered Entity” or “CE” shall have the same meaning as the term “covered entity” at 45 C.F.R. 160.103.

	3) *Privacy and Security Rule:* “Privacy and Security Rule” shall mean the Privacy, Security, Breach Notification, and Enforcement Rules at 45 C.F.R. Part 160 and Part 164.

2. *Permitted Uses and Disclosures by Business Associate*.

	a. BA may only use or disclose PHI for the following purposes: in the
rendering of services as described in Appendix C of this document.

	b. BA may use or disclose PHI as required by law.

	c. BA agrees to make uses and disclosures and requests for PHI
consistent with CE’s minimum necessary policies and procedures.

	d. BA may not use or disclose PHI in a manner that would violate Subpart
E of 45 C.F.R. Part 164 if done by CE, except for the specific uses and
disclosures set out below.

	e. BA may disclose PHI for the proper management and administration of
BA or to carry out the legal responsibilities of BA, provided the
disclosures are required by law, or BA obtains reasonable assurances
from the person to whom the information is disclosed that the
information will remain confidential and used or further disclosed only
as required by law or for the purposes for which it was disclosed to the
person, and the person notified BA of any instances of which it is aware
in which the confidentiality of the information has been breached.

	f. BA may provide data aggregation services related to the health care
operations of CE.

3. *Obligations of Business Associate*.

	a. *Permitted uses and disclosures*: BA may only use and disclose PHI owned by the CE that it creates, receives, maintains, or transmits if the use or disclosure is in compliance with each applicable requirement of 45 C.F.R. 164.504(e) of the Privacy Rule or this BAA. The additional requirements of Subtitle D of the HITECH Act contained in Public Law 111-5 that relate to privacy and that are made applicable with respect to Covered Entities shall also be applicable to BA and are incorporated into this BAA.

	To the extent that BA discloses CE’s PHI to a subcontractor, BA must
obtain, prior to making any such disclosure: (1) reasonable assurances
from the subcontractor that it will agree to the same restrictions,
conditions, and requirements that apply to the BA with respect to such
information; and (2) an agreement from the subcontractor to notify BA
of any Breach of confidentiality, or security incident, within two
business days of when it becomes aware of such Breach or incident.

	b. *Safeguards*: 45 C.F.R. 164.308 (administrative safeguards), 164.310
    (physical safeguards), 164.312 (technical safeguards), and 164.316
    (policies, procedures and documentation requirements) shall apply to
    BA in the same manner that such sections apply to CE, and shall be
    implemented in accordance with HIPAA, the HITECH Act, and the
    Privacy and Security Rule. The additional requirements of Title XIII
    of the HITECH Act contained in Public Law 111-5 that relate to
    security and that are made applicable to Covered Entities shall also
    apply to BA and are incorporated into this BAA.

	Unless CE agrees in writing that this requirement is infeasible with
respect to certain data, BA shall secure all paper and electronic PHI
by encryption or destruction such that the PHI is rendered unusable,
unreadable or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals; or secure
paper, film and electronic PHI in a manner that is consistent with
guidance issued by the Secretary of the United States Department of
Health and Human Services specifying the technologies and
methodologies that render PHI unusable, unreadable or indecipherable
to unauthorized individuals, including the use of standards developed
under Section 3002(b)(2)(B)(vi) of the Public Health Service Act, as
added by Section 13101 of the HITECH Act contained in Public Law
111-5.

	BA shall patch its operating system and all applications within two weeks of the release of any patch. BA shall keep its antivirus and antimalware installed and active. BA shall limit its use of administrative accounts for IT operations only.

	c. *Reporting Unauthorized Disclosures and Breaches*: During the term of this BAA, BA shall notify CE within 24 hours of discovering a Breach of security; intrusion; or unauthorized acquisition, access, use or disclosure of CE’s PHI in violation of any applicable federal or state law, including security incidents. BA shall identify for the CE the individuals whose unsecured PHI has been, or is reasonably believed to have been, Breached so that CE can comply with any notification requirements if necessary. BA shall also indicate whether the PHI subject to the Breach; intrusion; or unauthorized acquisition, access, use or disclosure was encrypted or destroyed at the time. BA shall take prompt corrective action to cure any deficiencies that result in Breaches of security; intrusion; or unauthorized acquisition, access, use, and disclosure. BA shall fulfill all breach notice requirements unless CE notifies BA that CE will take over the notice requirements. BA shall reimburse CE for all costs incurred by CE that are associated with any mitigation, investigation and notice of Breach CE undertakes or provides under HIPAA, HITECH Act, and the Privacy and Security Rule as a result of a Breach of CE’s PHI caused by BA or BA’s subcontractor or agent.

	If the unauthorized acquisition, access, use or disclosure of CE’s PHI involves only Secured PHI, BA shall notify CE within 10 days of discovering the Breach but is not required to notify CE of the names of the individuals affected.

	d. BA is not an agent of CE.

	e. *BA’s Agents*: If BA uses a subcontractor or agent to provide
services under this BAA, and the subcontractor or agent creates,
receives, maintains, or transmits CE’s PHI, the subcontractor or agent
shall sign an agreement with BA containing substantially the same
provisions as this BAA and further identifying CE as a third-party
beneficiary with rights of enforcement and indemnification from the
subcontractor or agent in the event of any violation of the
subcontractor or agent agreement. BA shall mitigate the effects of any
violation of that agreement.

	f. *Availability of Information to CE*: Within 15 days after the date of
a written request by CE, BA shall provide any information necessary to
fulfill CE's obligations to provide access to PHI under HIPAA, the
HITECH Act, or the Privacy and Security Rule.

	g. *Accountability of Disclosures*: If BA is required by HIPAA, the
HITECH Act, or the Privacy or Security Rule to document a disclosure of
PHI, BA shall make that documentation. If CE is required to document a
disclosure of PHI made by BA, BA shall assist CE in documenting
disclosures of PHI made by BA so that CE may respond to a request for an
accounting in accordance with HIPAA, the HITECH Act, and the Privacy and
Security Rule. Accounting records shall include the date of the
disclosure, the name and if known, the address of the recipient of the
PHI, the name of the individual who is subject of the PHI, a brief
description of the PHI disclosed and the purpose of the disclosure.
Within 15 days of a written request by CE, BA shall make the accounting
record available to CE.

	h. *Amendment of PHI*: Within 30 days of a written request by CE or an
individual, BA shall amend PHI maintained, transmitted, created or
received by BA on behalf of CE as directed by CE or the individual when
required by HIPAA, the HITECH Act or the Privacy and Security Rule, or
take other measures as necessary to satisfy CE’s obligations under 45
C.F.R. 164.526.

	i. *Internal Practices*: BA shall make its internal practices, books and
records relating to the use and disclosure of CE's PHI available to CE
and all appropriate federal agencies to determine CE's and BA's
compliance with HIPAA, the HITECH Act and the Privacy and Security Rule.

	j. *Risk Assessment*: BA shall biennially conduct a thorough assessment
of the potential risks to and vulnerabilities of the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of CE’s PHI that BA receives, stores,
transmits, or has access to, and shall provide CE with a written report
detailing the results of the assessment within 60 days of completing it.

	k. To the extent BA is to carry out one or more of CE’s obligations
under Subpart E of 45 C.F.R. Part 164, BA must comply with the
requirements of that Subpart that apply to CE in the performance of such
obligations.

	l. *Audits, Inspection and Enforcement*: CE may, after providing
reasonable notice to the BA, conduct an inspection of the facilities,
systems, books, logs and records of BA that relate to BA’s use of CE’s
PHI, including inspecting logs showing the creation, modification,
viewing, and deleting of PHI at BA’s level. Failure by CE to inspect
does not waive any rights of the CE or relieve BA of its
responsibility to comply with this BAA. CE's failure to detect or
failure to require remediation does not constitute acceptance of any
practice or waive any rights of CE to enforce this BAA.

	Notwithstanding BA’s obligation to report under paragraph 3.c of this
BAA, BA shall provide a monthly report to CE detailing the
unauthorized, or reasonable belief of unauthorized, acquisition,
access, use, or disclosure of CE’s PHI, including any unauthorized
creation, modification, or destruction of PHI and unauthorized login
attempts. BA shall include privileged and nonprivileged accounts in
its audit and report, indicating the unique individual using the
privileged account. BA shall also indicate whether CE’s PHI subject to
unauthorized activity was encrypted or destroyed at the time of the
unauthorized activity.

	BA shall provide a yearly report to CE that lists the names of all
individuals with technical or physical access to CE’s PHI and the
scope of that access.

	m. *Restrictions and Confidential Communications*: Within 10 business
days of notice by CE of a restriction upon use or disclosure or request
for confidential communications pursuant to 45 C.F.R.164.522, BA shall
restrict the use or disclosure of an individual’s PHI. BA may not
respond directly to an individual’s request to restrict the use or
disclosure of PHI or to send all communication of PHI to an alternate
address. BA shall refer such requests to the CE so that the CE can
coordinate and prepare a timely response to the requesting individual
and provide direction to the BA.

	n. *Indemnification*: BA shall indemnify and hold harmless CE for any
civil or criminal monetary penalty imposed on CE or monetary settlement
reached by CE for acts or omissions in violation of HIPAA, the HITECH
Act, or the Privacy or Security Rule that are committed by BA, a member
of its workforce, its agent, or its subcontractor.

4. *Obligations of CE*. CE will be responsible for using legally
appropriate safeguards to maintain and ensure the confidentiality,
privacy and security of PHI transmitted to BA under the BAA until the
PHI is received by BA. CE will not request BA to use or disclose PHI in
any manner that would not be permissible under HIPAA, the HITECH Act or
the Privacy and Security Rule if done by CE.

5. *Termination*.

	a. *Breach*: A breach of a material term of the BAA by BA that is not
cured within a reasonable period of time will provide grounds for the
immediate termination of the contract.

	b. *Reasonable Steps to Cure*: In accordance with 45 C.F.R.
164.504(e)(1)(ii), CE and BA agree that, if it knows of a pattern of
activity or practice of the other party that constitutes a material
breach or violation of the other party’s obligation under the BAA, the
nonbreaching party will take reasonable steps to get the breaching party
to cure the breach or end the violation and, if the steps taken are
unsuccessful, terminate the BAA if feasible, and if not feasible, report
the problem to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services.

	c. *Effect of Termination*: Upon termination of the contract, BA will,
at the direction of the CE, either return or destroy all PHI received
from CE or created, maintained, or transmitted on CE’s behalf by BA in
any form. Unless otherwise directed, BA is prohibited from retaining any
copies of PHI received from CE or created, maintained, or transmitted by
BA on behalf of CE. If destruction or return of PHI is not feasible, BA
must continue to extend the protections of this BAA to PHI and limit the
further use and disclosure of the PHI. The obligations in this BAA shall
continue until all of the PHI provided by CE to BA is either destroyed
or returned to CE.

6. *Amendment*. The parties acknowledge that state and federal laws
relating to electronic data security and privacy are evolving, and that
the parties may be required to further amend this BAA to ensure
compliance with applicable changes in law. Upon receipt of a
notification from CE that an applicable change in law affecting this BAA
has occurred, BA will promptly agree to enter into negotiations with CE
to amend this BAA to ensure compliance with changes in law.

7. *Ownership of PHI*. For purposes of this BAA, CE owns the data that
contains the PHI it transmits to BA or that BA receives, creates,
maintains or transmits on behalf of CE.

8. *Litigation Assistance*.  Except when it would constitute a direct
conflict of interest for BA, BA will make itself available to assist CE
in any administrative or judicial proceeding by testifying as witness as
to an alleged violation of HIPAA, the HITECH Act, the Privacy or
Security Rule, or other law relating to security or privacy.

9. *Regulatory References*. Any reference in this BAA to federal or
state law means the section that is in effect or as amended.

10. *Interpretation*. This BAA shall be interpreted as broadly as
necessary to implement and comply with HIPAA, the HITECH Act, the
Privacy and Security Rule and applicable state and federal laws. The
parties agree that any ambiguity in BAA will be resolved in favor of a
meaning that permits the CE to comply with and be consistent with
HIPAA, the HITECH Act, and the Privacy and Security Rule. The parties
further agree that where this BAA conflicts with a contemporaneously
executed confidentiality agreement between the parties, this BAA
controls.

11. *No Private Right of Action Created.* This BAA does not create any
right of action or benefits for individuals whose PHI is disclosed in
violation of HIPAA, the HITECH Act, the Privacy and Security Rule or
other law relating to security or privacy.

**In witness thereof,** the parties hereto have duly executed this BAA
as of the effective date.
